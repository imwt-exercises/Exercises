            <p align="center"><b>By Erin Overbey and Joshua Rothman</b>   January 27, 2019</p>
            <div align="center"><img src="Sunday-Reading-The-Internet.jpg" height="100%" width="100%"></div>
            <p>Today, for better and for worse, the Internet is a part of all of 
                our lives. But it wasn’t always so. This week, we’re bringing 
                you pieces from the early days of tech culture, when going 
                online was a novelty and kids still played outside. In “My First 
                Flame,” from 1994, John Seabrook describes his first experience 
                with online insults and trolling (“in any other medium, these 
                words would be, literally, unspeakable”); he also undertakes an 
                electronic correspondence with Bill Gates, in “E-Mail from 
                Bill.” (“We were intimate in a curious way, in the sense of 
                being wired into each other’s minds, but our contact was 
                elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing.”) In “Virtual 
                Love,” from 1997, Meghan Daum experiments with Internet dating, 
                despite not being “what most people would call a ‘computer 
                person.’ ” John Heilemann, John Cassidy, and Michael Specter 
                offer early profiles of Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry 
                Page and Sergey Brin, respectively. Erik Larson recounts the 
                story of iVillage, the Internet company whose two female 
                co-founders, Nancy Evans and Candice Carpenter, became 
                unimaginably rich through an I.P.O., despite being “neither ‘Web 
                heads’ nor computer geeks,” signalling a new era in tech. Lauren 
                Collins explores a new form of self-expression—the clever naming 
                of one’s Wi-Fi network. Nicholson Baker uses a Kindle for the 
                first time and wonders if a device could ever be better than a 
                book. Finally, in a Talk of the Town story, from 1977, Anthony 
                Hiss visits an acquaintance in California with a new hobby: 
                assembling his own personal computer. Eventually, his 
                acquaintance predicts, people will “start hooking their machines 
                in with their friends’ machines, and people will get on nets of 
                computers, which could mean you could vote or buy something 
                while sitting at your own computer keyboard.” He notes that “if 
                the electricity fails, the kids will be in trouble.” He didn’t 
                know the half of it.</p>

            <p>“I got flamed for the first time a couple of months ago. To 
                flame, according to ‘Que’s Computer User’s Dictionary,’ is ‘to 
                lose one’s self-control and write a message that uses 
                derogatory, obscene, or inappropriate language.’ ”</p>

			<img src="Sunday-Reading-970825_ra610.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
            <p>“Thanks to the computer, I was involved in a well-defined 
                courtship, a neat little space in which he and I were both safe 
                to express the panic and the fascination of our mutual 
                affection.”</p>

            <img src="Sunday-Reading-970908_ra613.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
			<p>“Steve Jobs’s mastery of perception has long been known to his 
                allies and his detractors alike as his ‘reality-distortion 
                field’—an uncanny ability, through enthusiasm, charisma, and 
                intimidation, to make people see what he wants them to see.”</p>
            <hr>
			<h4 id="anchor-4">“<u>Me Media</u>”</h4>
            <p>The growth of sites like Facebook and MySpace reflects a dramatic 
                shift in how young people view the Internet.”</p>
            <hr>
			<h4 id="anchor-5">“<u>The Tao of Wi-Fi</u>”</h4>
            <p>Wireless names can act as welcome mats, luring their beholder 
                into a store or a discussion, or as gargoyles, patrolling a 
                patch of virtual turf.”</p>
            <hr>
			<h4 id="anchor-6">“<u>Free Money</u>”</h4>
            <p>A company as ethereal as air, with deep losses, few physical 
                assets, little proprietary technology, extravagant rates of 
                spending, a high employee ‘burn rate,’ and powerful emerging 
                competitors, had accomplished one of the most successful I.P.O.s 
                ever.”</p>

			<h4 id="anchor-7">“<u>A New Page</u>”</h4>
            <p>“Here’s what you buy when you buy a Kindle book. You buy the 
                right to display a grouping of words in front of your eyes for 
                your private use with the aid of an electronic display device 
                approved by Amazon.”</p>

			<h4 id="anchor-8">“<u>Search and Deploy</u>”</h4>
            <p>At the age of twenty-seven, Lawrence Page runs—with a fellow 
                former Stanford graduate student, Sergey Brin—a small company, 
                based in Mountain View, California, named Google, which has 
                become the default search engine of the digital in-crowd.”</p>

            <p>“Sitting at my computer one day, I realized that I could try to 
                communicate with Bill Gates, the chairman and co-founder of the 
                software giant Microsoft, on the information highway.”</p>
            <hr>
			<h4 id="anchor-10">“<u>Bytes and Chips</u>”</b></h4>
            <p>In just a matter of weeks, a couple of men in their twenties from 
                Los Altos, California will start selling Apple II—a fully 
                assembled briefcase-size unit, with a large memory and a 
                keyboard, that can play any number of computer games, draw 
                pictures on your color TV, and operate like any other 
                computer.”</p>
